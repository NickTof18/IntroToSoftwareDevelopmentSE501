# IntroToSoftwareDevelopmentSE501

This is a homework assignment I had to complete for SE501, Intro to Software Development.  I took the class in the Fall of my Senior Year/First Year Graduate Student (2018) at the University of Scranton.  

Assignment 1 required students to create an application (in any programming language they choose) that can find all the declared variables of a programâ€™s source code (written in any programming language they choose), and give a list of where the variables appear in the code.  I wrote a short program in Swift that finds all the variable declarations and the places the variables appear in [Pep 9](http://computersystemsbook.com/5th-edition/pep9/).  I chose to write the program in Swift because I have a ton of experience with writing applications for iOS in Swift, but very little experience writing an application that runs on MacOS in Swift, so I saw this as a great opportunity to learn.  I chose to get the variables from a Pep9 source code file because I joked with the teacher about doing it, since most students dislike Pep9, and he said he was interested in how I would approach the problem, so I decided to try it.
